      "text": " This game is good despite what other people say. Its not a 10/10 or even an 8/10, its no masterpiece but its a good damn game. A lot of what people have issues with is how it doesn't compare to the first game and its decisions and setting. Its all subjective which I for one loved the setting this game takes place, the university is beautiful and the turtle is cozy for example. I love the use of colour, blue and dark for sadness and death, and yellow and brightness for life and happiness.<br><br> The decisions on the other hand... yes... yes yes yes they do kinda suck most of the time, the major decisions literally have no impact on the story usually, it just leads to people telling you the same thing in a different tone or different way. What carried this game for me was the story and plot. Every episode had great cliff hangers and the murder mystery vibe of it all was captivating, confusing and exciting. I played the whole game in one sitting because of this and it was great finding clues and finding answers. After the murder parts are resolved it continues to be exciting and confusing with the storm and the trauma the characters are going through. It makes references to the first game all throughout the playthrough showing that trauma even more.<br><br> The characters were also fine nothing I can complain about. Most of the characters were lovable and for the ones who weren't their actions were always warranted. Again not a 10/10 not everyone is like a Max Caulfield, who in this game still matches up to the Max Caulfield from the first game so thats a big thumbs up.<br><br> Finally the ending wasn't great, think everyone can agree with that. It feels half finished cause the real ending is coming in the next game. Love it or hate it I think that's just the reality.<br><br> Overall the game was fun, its very visually appealing and the story kept my attention the whole way through. It loses me knowing most of the decisions don't mean anything but its still fun and a joy to be a part of.<br><br> 7/10",

      "text": "Never did I think I'd be able to love a game series like I do this one. I heard about this series back when only Season 1 was out and it started to grow on me immediately, dying of anticipation for the next episode and season to come out. I loved being able to follow Clementine's journey and the choices the game throws at you are mind bending at times. I always loved each of the previous seasons but this season was just something different. I just finished my second play-through and I had completely forgot about most things. Everything was such a joy to play through, I didn't remember being as emotional as the first time around... maybe its cause I'm older now. Clementine almost inspires me in life. Her will to keep going, her bravery, her love for others and doing the right thing. She teaches and learns... she grows up. Obviously she wont be entirely like that for everyone but this game is what you make it. Makes everything super relatable and that's the magic in this game. You really grow to care about these fictional people on your screen, but they feel real and genuine (some exceptions...). Making everything in this game a 10/10 experience. I love this series and I always will. I can't say that about any other game, its a special masterpiece.",
