                    <h1>Austin St-Jean</h1>
                    <div>Welcome to my website! My name is Austin St-Jean, a newly graduated computer science student with
                        hands-on experience working with multiple government companies. I thrive in collaborative
                        environments, bringing strong organizational skills and communication to every
                        project. Here, youâ€™ll find insights into my career, personal projects, and passions, as well as
                        some games you may be familiar with.
                        Feel free to explore and connect with me through my networks!
